Project Title:
InnovaAI – AI-Powered Hackathon Companion

About:
InnovaAI is a web app built during a hackathon to assist participants by combining AI tools with productivity-features. It provides a clean, fast, and interactive front-end interface for users to leverage AI in their workflow.

Live Demo : https://avinya-innovaai-b3e9.vercel.app/

Features:
Here are some of the features as seen from the deployed app (to be adjusted if there are more in the backend):
-Clean landing page / UI: First impression is professional, modern, responsive.
-AI-Assisted Tools / Components: Probably includes some helper components (chat, suggestions, maybe automation).
-Navigation / Structure: Clear sections, likely about, features, contact, etc.
-Responsive design: Works across devices (desktop, mobile) ‒ thanks to Tailwind CSS.
-Performance optimized: Since using Vite, fast loading and build speeds.

Technology Stack:
Layer	Tech
Frontend framework / build tool	Vite
Language	TypeScript
Styling	Tailwind CSS + PostCSS
Code quality / linting	ESLint
Deployment hosting	Vercel

Problem Statement:
Hackathons are intense; participants need tools which help speed up ideation, prototyping, documentation.
AI can assist with tasks like generating code snippets, giving suggestions, automating parts of design or content creation.
InnovaAI intends to reduce friction: less time setting up, more time building.

Goals:
Provide an AI-assisted environment to improve productivity.
Have a polished UI so it looks professional.
Make something deployable, scalable, and usable immediately (demo/pitch ready).
Encourage clean code, maintainability.

Usage:
(Assuming features; you can adapt after testing)
-Go to the app URL.
-Navigate through the UI: see feature sections / offerings.
-Use any AI tools built (chat/suggestion/automations).
-Provide feedback or contact via provided links.

Structure (Code):
src/ – frontend source code
index.html – entry point
tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js – styling setup
vite.config.ts – build & dev server configuration
eslint.config.js – linting rules
TypeScript config files for type safety

Future Work / Enhancements:
You could mention:
Addition of backend integration (e.g. APIs for AI models).
More AI modules (image generation, summarization, etc.).
User accounts, persistent data.
Customizable user settings.
Better accessibility, multi-language.
